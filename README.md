# RedditGifBot

Hello, 
I make simple windows bot. I hope it helps someone.

This bot works thanks to site scrolller.com where you can find huge amount of popular GIFs. It grabs GIFs url from this site and after that it can be uploaded 
to selected subreddit. Bot works in 2 steps: "Get GIF links" button grab GIFs url links and "Upload" button upload it to selected subreddit. On Scrolller.com
website you can choose from any content, after your choice  take url with your content and paste it to Scrolller url field.
